### Definition of organizational culture


<dl>
  <dt>Culture is a "system of rules and habits that guide how people live and behave together."

>
<dd> - Cecil Herman</dd>

### Components of a organizational culture:

- social system
- "rules":  
     -     values 
     -     norms 
     -     worldviews

 #### -> Behavior

---
Organizational culture is experienced internally, for example, by the fact that
- ... everyone works perceptibly towards a goal and everyone does what is necessary at their place to support their colleagues to the best of their ability.

Externals experience organizational culture, for example, in the fact that
- ...the customer is still cared after by a retailer with the same attention as before, even after the purchase of a product or service.
