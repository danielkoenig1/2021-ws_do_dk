### Definition of organizational culture


<dl>
  <dt>Culture is a "system of rules and habits that guide how people live and behave together."

>
<dd> - Cecil Herman</dd>

---
### Components of a organizational culture:

- social system
- "rules":  
     -     values 
     -     norms 
     -     worldviews

 #### -> Behavior

---
Organizational culture is experienced internally, for example, by the fact that
- ... everyone works perceptibly towards a goal and everyone does what is necessary at their place to support their colleagues to the best of their ability.

Externals experience organizational culture, for example, in the fact that
- ...the customer is still cared after by a retailer with the same attention as before, even after the purchase of a product or service.

| ----------------------|:--------------------------------:|
| Coaching employees    | mentoring, supporting and reflecting on results |
| Improvement-oriented environment | gaining experience independently |
| Setting an example of the desired culture | Management acts as a good role model |

Notes: What the exact content of coaching is, in what areas employees can drive change independently, and what values management exemplifies. Depends on various factors.
